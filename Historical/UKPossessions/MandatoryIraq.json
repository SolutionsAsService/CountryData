  "summary": "Mandatory Iraq, also known as the Kingdom of Iraq under British Administration, was created following the Iraqi Revolt against the proposed British Mandate of Mesopotamia. It existed from 1921 to 1932 under the League of Nations mandate with British administration. The territory was led by High Commissioner Percy Cox, followed by Francis Humphrys, and King Faisal I. Despite British efforts, the period was marked by growing nationalist anger and an incomplete establishment of British authority, particularly in Kurdish regions. Mandatory Iraq was a precursor to the fully independent Kingdom of Iraq."
