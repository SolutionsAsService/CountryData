  "summary": "The Ottoman Empire was a vast and enduring empire that controlled regions of Southeast Europe, West Asia, North Africa, and parts of Central Europe between the 14th and early 20th centuries. Known for its military prowess, cultural richness, and architectural achievements, the empire was founded by Osman I and lasted until the early 20th century. It was a center for trade, arts, and learning, influencing regions far beyond its borders. The empire underwent significant changes, including constitutional reforms and periods of dictatorship, before its dissolution and transformation into the Republic of Turkey and other modern states."
