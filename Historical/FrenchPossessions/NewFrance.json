  "summary": "New France was the territory colonized by France in North America from 1534 until 1763. It began with Jacques Cartier's exploration and expanded to cover a vast area. The region was characterized by French language, Catholic religion, and a viceroyalty governance structure. It experienced significant development and conflict, including the French and Indian War. The Treaty of Utrecht and the Treaty of Paris were pivotal, leading to its cession to Great Britain and Spain. Today, its legacy continues in parts of Canada, the United States, and Saint Pierre and Miquelon."
