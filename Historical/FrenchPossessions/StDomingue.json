  "summary": "Saint-Domingue was a French colony on the western part of Hispaniola from 1659 to 1804. It was renowned for its wealth and production of commodities like sugar and coffee. The Treaty of Ryswick in 1697 recognized French control, which led to significant economic and demographic growth. The colony was a pivotal site of the Haitian Revolution, beginning with the Vodou ceremony at Bois Caïman in 1791, leading to the abolition of slavery and eventual independence of Haiti in 1804 after a prolonged conflict and shifting control over Hispaniola."
