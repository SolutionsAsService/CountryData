  "summary": "The French Protectorate in Morocco, established by the Treaty of Fes in 1912, was a period of French colonial rule marked by an absolute monarchy under colonial administration. While Sultan Mohammed V and his successors nominally ruled, real power was held by French Resident-Generals like Hubert Lyautey. Morocco's independence movement led to the restoration of Mohammed V and the end of the protectorate in 1956, though France continued to exert influence in the country. The protectorate was characterized by a complex relationship between French settlers, the indigenous population, and the ruling monarchy, and it played a significant role in shaping modern Morocco."
