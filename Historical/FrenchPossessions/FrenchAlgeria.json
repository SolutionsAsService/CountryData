  "summary": "French Algeria, known officially as Algérie française, was a territory under French control from 1830 to 1962, transitioning from a colony to an integral part of France. The region was characterized by a mix of French and Arab-Berber culture, with a significant European immigrant population known as pieds-noirs alongside the indigenous Muslim majority. Throughout its history, Algeria experienced significant demographic changes, political unrest, and a prolonged struggle for independence, which culminated in the Algerian War. The conflict ended with Algeria gaining independence in 1962, marking the end of French rule and the beginning of a new era for the Algerian nation."
