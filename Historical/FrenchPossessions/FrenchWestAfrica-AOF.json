  "summary": "French West Africa was a federation of eight French colonial territories in West Africa from 1895 until 1958. It was established during the New Imperialism era and included Mauritania, Senegal, Mali (formerly French Sudan), Guinea, Ivory Coast, Burkina Faso (formerly Upper Volta), Benin (formerly Dahomey), and Niger. The federation's capitals were Saint-Louis until 1902 and then Dakar. The region was known for its diverse languages and religions, with French serving as the official language. The territories within the federation varied in the length of their colonial period, reflecting the complex history of French colonization in the region. The federation existed until the late 1950s when the territories moved towards independence, leading to the establishment of separate nation-states and the end of the French colonial era in West Africa."
