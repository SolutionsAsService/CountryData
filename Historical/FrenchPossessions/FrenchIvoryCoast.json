  "summary": "French Ivory Coast was established as a French colony in 1893 following a series of treaties and military campaigns. Governed initially from Paris and later as part of French West Africa, the colony experienced forced labor systems, tax burdens, and efforts at cultural assimilation. Resistance, both passive and active, was met with military force and political pressure. Post-WWII reforms began changing the administrative landscape, leading to greater autonomy and eventually independence in 1960. The legacy of this colonial period has had lasting economic, cultural, and political impacts on Ivory Coast."
