  "summary": "The French Protectorate of Tunisia, established in 1881 and lasting until 1956, was a period of French colonial rule marked by constitutional monarchy under French protection. The protectorate was established through the Treaty of Bardo and involved significant French influence on Tunisian governance and society. Tunisians retained their language and religion but were heavily influenced by French culture, administration, and economics. This era ended when Tunisia gained independence in 1956, transitioning into the Kingdom of Tunisia."
