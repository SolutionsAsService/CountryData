  "summary": "The French colonization attempts in what is now Brazil were marked by several ambitious but ultimately unsuccessful endeavors to establish a permanent French presence in the region. From Equinoctial France in the 17th century to various efforts in the 16th century including France Antarctique, Fort Coligny, and the island of Saint Alexis, these attempts were characterized by conflicts with indigenous populations and competing European powers, most notably Portugal. The ventures often became havens for persecuted groups like the Huguenots but were eventually overcome by the Portuguese, leading to French withdrawal from the region."
