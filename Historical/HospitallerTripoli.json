  "summary": "Hospitaller Tripoli was a territory ruled by the Knights Hospitaller between 1530 and 1551 as a vassal of the Kingdom of Sicily. The city of Tripoli, along with the islands of Malta and Gozo, was granted to the Hospitallers by Spain. During this period, the Hospitallers faced challenges in controlling the region and debated moving their headquarters or abandoning the city. The rule ended following the Ottoman conquest in 1551, leading to a significant shift in the region's control and influence."
