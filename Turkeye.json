  "summary": "Turkey, officially the Republic of Türkiye, straddles Southeast Europe and West Asia, encompassing the rich cultural legacy of the Anatolian Peninsula and East Thrace. It's a melting pot of ethnicities, with Turks and Kurds forming major communities. Ankara serves as the capital, while Istanbul is the pulsating economic and cultural heart. Governed as a unitary presidential constitutional republic, Turkey has evolved through a complex history from the Ottoman Empire to a modern republic. Its strategic location has made it a geopolitical hub, bordered by eight countries and several seas. Turkey's blend of historical depth, cultural diversity, and economic vitality makes it a unique and dynamic nation."
